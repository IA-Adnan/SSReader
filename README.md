A screenshot-to-text automation tool that uses Tesseract OCR and Python to extract text from screenshots saved with `Win + PrintScreen` and outputs it to a folder and copies text content to clipboard. (will be) ready for ingestion into local LLMs (like AnythingLLM).

## 🛠 Features

- 🖼️ Auto-watches for screenshots in real-time
- 📄 Extracts and saves transcribed text as `.txt`
- 📋 Copies to clipboard
- 🧃 One-click install with bundled Python + Tesseract

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `screenshot_watcher_clipboard_updated.py` – OCR logic
- `tesseract/` – Tesseract binaries
- `python/` – Embedded Python environment

##
- Might add UI with hotkey setting support + mini tray launcher + and direct ingestion access for local LLM
